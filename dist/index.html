        <p>Amputees United Initiative is an initiative dedicated to enhancing the quality of life for amputees. With the support of the public, we are helping amputees live well with limb loss, raising awareness about management of limb loss and providing a platform to help them live their full and thriving lives.</p>
        <p>The initiative was birthed from a place of personal journey to provide a safe haven for amputees, fresh and old, where journeys will be shared and experience heard, to strengthen each other, as these special humans continue to clamour for an inclusive society geared towards preparing Lagos and Nigeria towards the United Nations path to achieving an inclusive society in line with SDG 17.</p>
        <p>Amputees United Initiative also creates a platform for persons with special needs to discuss matters affecting them specifically; ranging from educational needs, medical needs and infrastructural needs.</p>
        <p>The ultimate goal of the initiative is to create a facility encompassing amenities to promote an adaptive lifestyle (learning to use prosthetic limbs), establish recreational centres that are suitable for people with special needs, a gym specifically for PWDs; equipped with cycling and swimming facilities.</p>
